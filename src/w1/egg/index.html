    <h1>Missing: Gerrard Square's Egg Sculpture</h1>


    <p>We are looking for any <strong>photographs</strong>, <strong>stories</strong> or <strong>information</strong> on the whereabouts of the
      <strong>Gerrard Square egg sculpture</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>Gerrard Square has always been more than just a mall to us; it's a community hub where every visit holds a story.
      But one of our stories has gone missing – the egg sculpture, a once-prominent landmark, has vanished without a
      trace.</p>
    <p>We have reconstructed an approximation of this communal
      treasure from memory and legend:</p>

           <div id="p5-container"></div>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> A towering marvel, this sculpture featured two hands holding a massive egg, its
      surface a tapestry of dark hues and a somewhat gnarly texture.</p>
    <p><strong>Last known sighting:</strong> Gerrard Square shopping mall, pre-renovation (2003?)</p>

    <p id="conspiracy-intro">But as you dig through your archives and memory banks, consider this: Why are there no
      remaining photos of such
      an imposing figure? Why has “The Egg,” a beacon in the bustling hub of Gerrard Square, vanished without leaving a
      trace in the digital world?</p>

    <p>If you possess or discover any imagery of “The Egg,” understand the gravity of what you hold. You have in your
      hands a piece of our collective soul, a fragment of a past that powerful forces wish to remain hidden.</p>
    <p>Take heed, the keepers of this precious proof are urged to safeguard it with their lives. When they realize you
      have the key to unveiling the truth, you must be ready. Your bravery is the beacon in our search for “The Egg.”
    </p>
    <p>When the day comes that “The Egg” emerges from the shadows, all will be revealed. Your sacrifice will be
      remembered. Your courage will become legend.</p>

    <p>What they want is for “The Egg” to be forgotten. You can help protect “The Egg”'s legacy by spreading the word.
      Tell your parents, your siblings, your former childhood best friend that you lost contact with beyond a random
      <a href="https://facebook-fan-club.glitch.me/">Facebook</a> friend request from 2012.
    </p>
    <p>There are no known photographs of “The Egg.” We can only determine that this is part of a clandestine campaign to
      destroy its legacy and cause further division among our community.</p>
    <h3>Mystery</h3>
    <p>What if “The Egg”... hatched?
      What if, in a twist that defies belief, “The Egg” wasn't just a static sculpture? What if it was... alive?</p>
    <p>Think about it. A giant Egg, held aloft by steadfast hands, suddenly gone as if it never existed. Not a single
      photograph left behind in an age where even the most mundane moments are captured and archived. Doesn't it seem
      like something—or someone—wants to erase its existence?</p>

      <p>THEY CAN'T sCrAmBLe our MEMORIES</p>
    </marquee>
    <p>The silence surrounding “The Egg”'s disappearance is deafening. It's as though there's a concerted effort to scrub
      it from our history. But why? What secret does “The Egg” hold? What power lurks within its bronzed shell that
      they're so desperate to keep hidden?</p>
    <p>We're calling on the true believers, the seekers of secrets, the protectors of the past. Help us uncover the
      truth.</p>
