      <h1>Sniff</h1>
    <p>My first hamster&apos;s name was <em>Hammy</em>. We called her &ldquo;Hams&quot;. She was a peach banded
      hamster.
    </p>
    <p>Our second hamster&apos;s name was <em>Futon</em>. We called her &ldquo;Foot&quot; for short (rhymes with
      &ldquo;boot&quot;). She was a brown hamster.</p>
    <p>Our third and final hamster&apos;s name was
      <em>Nutchuck</em>. We called her &ldquo;Nuttys&quot;. Her fur was golden and she had subtle brown and white marks
      on her cheeks
    </p>

      Hamsters have undoubtedly had a huge impact on my life and continue to influence
      me today. I&apos;d like to thank all the hamsters in my life for being a positive influence on the person I am.
